Home to KerbalController!

This is a personalized Kerbal Space Program console built using a PocketBeagle and kRPC. 

More information can be found on my Hackster Page: https://www.hackster.io/rfn1/pocketkerbal-ksp-console-using-pocketbeagle-krpc-d380ad 

The program you need to use/edit is called Project_1_v2
It is actually intiated using a run program. 

Open up the correct folder and then type:
sudo ./run
to run the program.
Unless a server is open in KSP, it will return an error.

This mod runs using kRPC. After it is installed, make sure the correct settings for your device are in the popup. A server is established once you hit "start" and have a rocket on the pad - at this point the program can connect.

This is still a work in progress and will be updated soon.
